We learned in Level 4 how to create a table using the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> command. Now, we're going to build on that by learning how to create tables with ID's. </p>"

    content: "<p> We've started you off with an empty database. Your job is to create a missiles table that has ID's in it. The convention for ID's is that they are <code> PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT </code>. <code> PRIMARY KEY </code> simply means that the column is UNIQUE and NOT NULL. AUTOINCREMENT means that this column's values will increment by 1 every time a new row is added.</p>"
